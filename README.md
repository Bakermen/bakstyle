# bakstyle README

## Why

A vscode theme I made, because I can't find any themes to my liking in the extension store.

## Can I use it?

if you would like to use this theme, feel free to do so, I don't think I will publish it to the extension store; because Microsoft.

## How do I use it?

download the theme as a zip file, extract it and copy it into %USERPROFILE%/.vscode/extensions, then open the settings json file by pressing ctrl+shift+p and searching for Preferences:Open Settings(JSON), and type "BakStyle" instead of the theme you have :).
